## <h4> Hi, Iâ€™m Antonia </h4>

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Marketing
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Business Analytics 

I am a marketer who recently decided to study Business Analytics to combine both subjects. I am passionate about understanding the psychology behind each product and being able to combine it with coding could be a great advantage to deepen the decisions that are made. Some of the technologies I have worked with include Python and Mashing Learning, but R and SQL will be added soon. In this profile I share some of the work that I have done in courses taken.
